Before, college admissions liked people who created nonprofits that represented the applicant's major of interest, such as teaching coding to younger kids. And it's easy to see why: creating and managing these organizations demonstrate leadership, social skills, and understanding of business, and knowledge and passion in education of the major of choice.

Unfortunately, when someone starts to do something just for the sake of doing it, the worth is diminished.

I've seen quite a few nonprofit organizations started by high schoolers (or, god forbid, their parents) who's only goal is to serve as a stepping stone into college. It would have be completely fine (hey, it benefits the community anyway, no matter the motives), but only if they actually taught decent material.

This leads to inexperienced teachers who teach wrong information to younger kids. While those who continue with programming are most likely able to correct their own faults, it's still inherently not a good way to educate. Although some of these organizations are great, others straight up copy information from crappy websites (ahem, ahem, w3schools) and put them on slides. 

On this topic, theres also been a rise in hackathons hosted by high schoolers. With the same pattern of coding camps, some of them are great, but some of them are plainly just a front for college admissions.

This might be a bit of coping on my part. A few months ago, me and my friends and I attended a quite large, quite well known regional hackathon hosted by a group of high schoolers and their parents. Over the timespan of two days, we created a rag application (yes, not the most innovative idea) using sveltekit and postgres that was able to transform user requests in natural language into database queries, allowing users to have a friendly interface to local supply stores. 

We lost to a single file tkinter program that outputted arbitrary numbers on the default window. We weren't even in the top three for our division.

We were promised judge feedback, but it never came. What's even more interesting is that our code was in a private github repository, and we had told the judges multiple times that if they wanted, we would add them as collaborators. They never asked for it.

What's *even more* interesting is that every team who won had an 11th grade student who wanted to major in CS. Coincidence? I think not.

But here's my speculation on these organizations. In the end, will they really help a student enter a great college? Maybe. But will it aid them in their future endeavors in software, or help them develop a passion for the field? Probably not.
