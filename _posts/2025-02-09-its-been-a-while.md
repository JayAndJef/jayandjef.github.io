Man. it's been over a year already.

To be honest, I completely forgot about this blog until I realized that I got gifted a free domain name with Github Education. The last post I've written on here was in Geometry class, when we were learning about shape transformations. 

Even after this long period of absence, however, I think this is a great way to document my works and such. They probably won't be about Haskell anymore, and I'm sorry to say that that planned 2023 AoC blog, nor the new years post isn't gonna be coming out anytime.

I'm aware that nobody reads this. This blog will probably serve more to be a way to introspect on my own thoughts and projects. Or maybe I'll forget and abandon it again for another year. Who knows?

I've actually written a note for myself at the start of 2024. I'm going to answer those now.

```
Right now I'm
 - Editing this file from nvim. Still using it?
 - Applying for private school - did I get in to any of these?
 - Working on NHD - did we make reigonals/states/(WORLDS?)?
 - Using rust - will java take over?
```

1. No. I've editor hopped a lot, but have settled on vscode.
2. Yes - I'm in one of them right now. Quite mid to be honest.
3. No, my project about the history of linux (which contained a **personal interview with stallman**) wasn't good enough for the reigonals judges.
4. I still use rust.

```
Did I
 - Pass USACO bronze yet? Or pursue something else?
 - Finally make a complex project?
 - Lose interest in anything?
```

1. I made bronze a month after I wrote that question.
2. I'm not sure. I've worked on somewhat complex projects, but I've had help in all of them. Truely, though, complexity isnt the only factor.
3. Not really.

```
Some more questions...
 - What's my GPA?
 - How's robotics - am I still going to do it in high school?
 - Looking back, is my workload still hard?
 - How's my basketball career?
```
1. 4.0. Not that it matters as much anymore.
2. Nope. At least, not this year.
3. Man, my Spanish and History teachers were such goats. The answer is yes.
4. Not bad, not good.
